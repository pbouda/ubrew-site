The μbrew development kit is a collection of open source projects and tools to
build a Linux system specialized on gaming for embedded devices like the
Raspberry Pi. It also features a toolchain and a game development kit to develop
your own apps and games for the supported devices.

We currently focus on the Raspberry Pi as the platform and the V-Play Game
Engine for game development.

If you are a developer and want to contribute to or modify our project you
can [fork our repositories at GitHub](https://github.com/ubrew-it).
