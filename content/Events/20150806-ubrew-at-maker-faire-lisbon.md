faire and are very proud to participate. If you are in Lisbon between September
18-20 you are welcome visit us in the Pavilhão do Conhecimento in Parque das
Nações. Prepare to play and learn about building your own embedded gaming
platform. We will have some Raspberries so that you can play with the μbrew
console, we will introduce our Embedded Linux environment and show you how to
develop μbrew games with Qt and V-Play. In addition we hereby promise some
surprises: we plan to take our favorite embedded gaming projects to the Maker
Faire for even more fun with Arduino & Co. Let's play in Lisbon!
