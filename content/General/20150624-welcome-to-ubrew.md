Welcome to the μbrew wesite about DIY and embedded gaming! We define the term
"embedded" rather loosely, and will blog about games and game development on
devices like the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.

In addition we hereby announce our DIY game development project based
on the Raspberry, Buildroot, Qt and the V-Play Game Engine. We call it the
"μbrew development kit". Our goal is not to initiate yet another game engine or
hardware project, but to demonstrate how existing embedded platforms and open
source projects can be used to easily build a customized gaming machine. It was
an opportunity to for us to learn about embedded development, and we want to
share what we learned with you. And learn even more from your feedback.

The μbrew development kit will consist of a minimal Linux system that boots
into a menu with all games that are supported on your device and that let you
download and install more games from a central and open repository. You are able
to use a state-of-the-art development environment to remix existing games or
build your own game for our supported platforms. The kit will be platform
independant, so that you can boot it on most major embedded development
platforms. Last but not least, all the games that you build will also work on
mobile phones, so that you can monetize your games at any time. Head over to
[our developer's section]({filename}/pages/developers.md) to install the
current version of the kit on your Raspberry and play your first game!

More information will follow over the next few posts in the coming weeks, so
stay tuned and watch out for more embedded gaming on ubrew.it!
