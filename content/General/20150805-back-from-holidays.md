We spent some days in beautiful Algarve, enjoyed the sun, relaxed a lot,
and had real world fun on roller coasters! Now we are back to Î¼brew and already
continued our work on the Panorama menu system with first successes to run PND
files on the Raspberry. More news about progress on the technical side and some
announcements about events will follow soon, so stay tuned!
