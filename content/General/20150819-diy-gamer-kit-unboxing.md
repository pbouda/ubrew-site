Recently we discovered one of the most amazing embedded gaming projects: it's
called "DIY Gamer Kit" designed and distributed by Technology Will Save Us. The
idea is that you get a kit and solder your own mobile game console based on an
Arduino Uno and a 8x8 pixel screen. Not exactly High DPI, but there are
aready several games on GitHub that you can load and play.

Of course we had to order one and it finally arrived! See our unboxing video:
