Welcome everybody! This is μbrew, your central place to find information about
gaming on embedded systems. We define the term "embedded" rather losely, and
will blog about games and game development on devices like the Arduino and
the Raspberry Pi.

Last but not least we hereby initiate a new game launcher project,
which we call the "μbrew Embedded Entertainment Kit". It will be a minimal
Linux system that boots into a menu with all games that are supported on your
device and that let you download and install more games from a central and open
repository. The Kit will be platform independant, so that you can boot
it on most major embedded development platforms. More information will follow
over the next few posts in the coming weeks, so stay tuned and watch out for
more embedded gaming on ubrew.it!
